# TyperDev ⌨️

TyperDev is an on-line app in which you can practice your typing speed with programming keywords.

This was an idea that came up when I was looking for a new keyboard to buy.

It still needs an API with programming related keywords, but it works accordingly with a sample text.

# Technologies ⚙️

I created this project using `Vite` as plugin. Chose `React` as framework and used `Typescript`, of course.

Styled the project using `Styled Components` and created its routes using `React Router Dom`.

It's the first project I handmade the Back-End logic using the `MERN` stack: `MongoDB`, `Express`, `ReactJS` and `NodeJS`.

Used `axios` to increase productivity when it comes down to fetching data, `bcrypt` to encrpt data and `Mongoose` as ORM.
